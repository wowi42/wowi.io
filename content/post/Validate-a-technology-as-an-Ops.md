During my job, I had to explain what is the flow to introduce a new technology, without creating frustration for developers. To validate a technology as an Ops, you need to check this list:

* Compilation/Building/Running on multiple OS/Env, including staging and production
* Documentation of this technology
* Professional support?
* Logs
* Monitoring
* Testing
* Community
* Pricing/Cost
* Alternatives

Then you send your report to the dev, and if the technology is not good enough, he/she will him/herself changes
