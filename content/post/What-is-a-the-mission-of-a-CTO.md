# 2. How to measure the CTO performance?

A CTO makes valuable contributions to your company, but when it comes to measuring your Chief Technology Officer’s performance, you can’t rely on the usual indicators. CTOs don’t develop new products every quarter or report on revenue, so their contribution to your company is not easily quantifiable. Therefore, it is important to know what qualitative indicators you should use. There are the 3 major key indicators. By assessing these, you are going to get a clear picture of your company’s CTO performance level. This indicators should be evaluated permanently.

## 2.1. Tech Strategy Alignment:

One of the main ways you can tell whether your CTO is keeping up with his/her position is by looking at how well your tech strategy lines up with your business strategy. Technical strategy should be an effective support for your overall business model, so if it is not, your CTO leaves something to be desired. On the other hand, if it meshes well and helps move your company forward you know who to thank.

## 2.2. Health of Engineering Culture:

Your Chief Technology Officer is expected to help recruit and retain top talent. This is can by creating a innovative and friendly working environment. In addition, your engineers need to have vision, and your CTO is the one who is going to provide them with it. The VP of Engineering should also be satisfied with the CTO’s contributions.

## 2.3. Employees' Satisfaction:

Other departments within your company rely on the Chief Technology Officer in terms of tech-related issues and initiatives. If they feel that the CTO is providing valuable input and being generally helpful, then performance is good. Otherwise, there are some improvments to be made.

# 3. CTO's time management?

There is no perfect answer for this one, but you need to allocate time to the engineering team and to your business team. The CTO will not be able to provide a good technical vision without being aware of business needs, and vice versa. The balance between technical and business parts should be business-driven.
